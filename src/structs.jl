$(TYPEDEF)

Abstract type for all clauses that match a grammar with rule labels of type `G` that match sequences of tokens of type `T`.

Currently implemented clauses:
- [`Satisfy`](@ref)
- [`Scan`](@ref)
- [`Token`](@ref)
- [`Tokens`](@ref)
- [`Epsilon`](@ref)
- [`Fail`](@ref)
- [`Seq`](@ref)
- [`First`](@ref)
- [`NotFollowedBy`](@ref)
- [`FollowedBy`](@ref)
- [`Some`](@ref)
- [`Many`](@ref)
- [`Tie`](@ref)

Often it is better to use convenience functions for rule construction, such as [`seq`](@ref) or [`token`](@ref); see [`flatten`](@ref) for details.
"""
abstract type Clause{G,T} end

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

A single terminal. Matches a token from the input stream where the `match`
function returns `true`.

# Fields
$(TYPEDFIELDS)
"""
struct Satisfy{G,T} <: Clause{G,T}
    match::Function
end

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

A single terminal, possibly made out of multiple input tokens.

Given the input stream and a position in it, the `match` function scans the
input forward and returns the length of the terminal starting at the position.
In case there's no match, it returns `nothing`.

# Fields
$(TYPEDFIELDS)
"""
struct Scan{G,T} <: Clause{G,T}
    match::Function
end

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

A single token equal to `match`.

# Fields
$(TYPEDFIELDS)
"""
struct Token{G,T} <: Clause{G,T}
    token::T
end

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

A series of tokens equal to `match`.

# Fields

$(TYPEDEF)

An always-succeeding epsilon match.
"""
struct Epsilon{G,T} <: Clause{G,T} end

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

An always-failing match.
"""
struct Fail{G,T} <: Clause{G,T} end

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

Sequence of matches. Empty `Seq` is equivalent to an always-succeeding empty
match, as in [`Epsilon`](@ref).

# Fields
$(TYPEDFIELDS)
"""
struct Seq{G,T} <: Clause{G,T}
    children::Vector{G}
end

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

Match the first possibility of several matches. Empty `First` is equivalent to
unconditional failure.

# Fields
$(TYPEDFIELDS)
"""
struct First{G,T} <: Clause{G,T}
    children::Vector{G}
end

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

Zero-length match that succeeds if `reserved` does _not_ match at the same position.

# Fields
$(TYPEDFIELDS)
"""
struct NotFollowedBy{G,T} <: Clause{G,T}
    reserved::G

$(TYPEDEF)

Zero-length match that succeeds if `follow` does match at the same position.

# Fields
$(TYPEDFIELDS)
"""
struct FollowedBy{G,T} <: Clause{G,T}
    follow::G
end

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

Greedily matches a sequence of matches, with at least 1 match.

# Fields
$(TYPEDFIELDS)
"""
struct Some{G,T} <: Clause{G,T}
    item::G

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

Greedily matches a sequence of matches that can be empty.

# Fields
$(TYPEDFIELDS)
"""
struct Many{G,T} <: Clause{G,T}
    item::G

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

Produces the very same match as the `item`, but concatenates the user views of
the resulting submatches into one big vector. (Thus basically squashing the 2
levels of child matches to a single one.) Useful e.g. for lists with different
initial or final elements. (As a result, the `item` and its immediate children
are _not_ going to be present in the parse tree.)
